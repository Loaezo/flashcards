# Flashcards

This app was developed to continue learning Flask and it consists in flashcards that helps you remember certain words and their translation in another language, in this case English-Spanish.

If wou want to sequentially read the flashcards, you can go to the landing page and click on the "Next" button to read the flashcards. You can also add your own flashcards in the home page and it will take you to a form where you can add a question and an answer. After successfully adding it, you will be directed to the newly created page, where you can see your newly-created flashcard.

This app was created using the Flask 1.1.2 framework. As this is a very simple app, there is no database storing the data, it uses a JSON file and it retrieves the key and the value. It can also be greatly improved in the styles and connecting it to a relational database.
